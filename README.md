Parallel-Image-Processing
=========================

The main purpose of this project is to use image processing to reconstruct an image using a data file that was the output of an edge detection algorithm such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel. However the aim is to do two-dimensional lattice-based calculation using a two-dimensional domain decomposition that uses non-blocking communications.
